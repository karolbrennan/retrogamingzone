# Retro Gaming Zone - 2016 (Archived)
#### Old URL
http://retrogaming.zone

Retro Gaming Zone was born out of a course requirement and my love for old school video games/consoles. My personal collection of old school consoles includes an Intellivision II, Atari 2600 and 7800, NES, SNES, N64, Sega Master System, and Playstation I & II. 

Sometimes I come across cheap console games for old systems, and figured it would be awesome to have a place to keep track of my collection and items on my wishlist. So I created this site.

### Features
- User registration / authentication system
- User dashboard complete with collection and wishlist functionality
- Gamification feature: leaderboard for who has the most items in their collection
- Game and console database complete with cover art

## Technology
This was my first Object Oriented PHP application. It was my first time for a lot of stuff.
That said: the code __SUCKS__. I mean it's really, *really* __bad__. Needs a full rewrite. So please don't judge me by this. This is public on github as a means to show how far I've come and how much I continue to grow.

### Development
This project was built using the [SimpleMVC (Now known as Nova) PHP Framework](http://novaframework.com/php-framework)

### Languages Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Object Oriented PHP
- JavaScript / AJAX

### Frameworks / Libraries Used
- Foundation CSS
- Normalize
- Modernizr
- Font Awesome icons
- jQuery
- jQuery UI
- Google reCaptcha
- Google Fonts
- Basically a lot of crap I did NOT need but was a requirement for the project at the time (as this was a midterm and final project for a college PHP course)

### Database Schema

*Note: This was my first attempt at designing and normalizing a database schema.*
